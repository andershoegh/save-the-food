# Save the food

Save the food helps people search for groceries that are about to expire, which people can both save money and help make sure we reduce food waste. Currently, Salling Group stores are supported (Netto, FÃ¸tex, Bilka).

This is a side-project made by @PeterKjaerFisker and @andersHoegh.

This application is in no way affiliated with Salling Group, however we appreciate them sharing their API publicly
